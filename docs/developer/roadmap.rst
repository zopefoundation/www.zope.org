Zope development roadmap
========================

The Zope development and support roadmap. **Last updated: October 2021**

If you use Plone, please visit the `Plone release schedule
<https://plone.org/download/release-schedule>`_ for all Plone-specific details.
Support for Zope releases aims to track support for the respective Plone
version(s) built on top of them.


Zope 6 - future version
-----------------------
At this moment there are no planned or actual changes that introduce backwards
incompatibilities and thus merit a new major version, so there is no planned
release date for Zope 6. All development still happens on Zope 5.

-----------------------
Plone 6, which is still under development, will use Zope 5.

      after it reached end-of-life status)
    - 3.7
    - 3.8
    - 3.9
    - 3.10 (planned for early 2022)
