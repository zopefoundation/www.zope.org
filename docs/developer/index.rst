Developer Information
=====================

This guide is for developers who are working **on** the various Zope-related
software projects, rather than for developers who work **with** those
projects' released software to build applications.  Developers in the
latter category should visit the general :doc:`../resources` section
instead.

The projects under the zopefoundation GitHub organization are open source and
welcome contributions in different forms:

* bug reports
* code improvements and bug fixes
* documentation improvements
* pull request reviews

For any changes in the repository besides trivial typo fixes you are required
to sign the contributor agreement. See :doc:`becoming-a-committer` for details.

Visit https://github.com/zopefoundation to see and browse all repositories
maintained by the Zope developer community. Published packages on PyPI are
bundled under the ``zope`` organization at https://pypi.org/org/zope/.
